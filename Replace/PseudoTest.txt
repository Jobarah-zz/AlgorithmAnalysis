Given the min-heap tree:
	 	  10 
	  40	  20
	90 	80 	30  50 
  100

we now replace the value of 20 with 200
  	 	  10 
	  40	  200
	90 	80 	30  50 
  100

after replacing it, we evaluate if it's parent is greater than the replaced value
then we swap the values

else we evaluate the value is greater than it's children, we then choose the least of it's children
and swap the values

after any of this conditions is met, then we reevaluate if the tree remains a min-heap reevluating with the swapped value

else we return the resultant tree
